# DIY suspension wizard - MTB suspension data logger system

This repo contains the documentation and source files related to the DIY suspension wizard - MTB data logger system that was implemented during Mechatronics Exercises course (KON-C3003) in 2021 in Aalto University. The idea of the project was to demonstrate a simple yet efficient data logging system for mountain bike suspension, which would allow the end-user to learn about the suspension performance and make adjustments less complicated (provide more indicators for the suspension performance). For a longer introduction and expanation, see the documentation `pdf`-file.

The contents of this repo mimic the original project documentation at [wiki.aalto.fi](https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/MEX/DIY+suspension+wizard+-+mountain+bike+suspension+data+logger) and the purpose of the repo is to keep the documentationavailable even if the original Aalto wiki is some day removed.
